The same word, and also abnegation (German: Verneinung), is used for a psychological defense mechanism postulated by psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, in which a person is faced with a fact that is too uncomfortable to accept and rejects it instead, insisting that it is not true despite what may be overwhelming evidence. An individual that exhibits such behavior is described as a denialist or true believer. Denial also could mean denying the happening of an event or the reliability of information, which can lead to a feeling of aloofness and to the ignoring of possibly beneficial information.\\n\\n***\\n\\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/prochoice/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28',\n",

The ultrasound was gut wrenching for me. as a mom of 2 kids and a miscarriage, it was very nostalgic, I was thinking back to every other time I found myself having an ultrasound and the emotions I felt with each one. Then later I could see glimpses of the US pictures as the counselor was going over my file. \\n\\nAlso, my medical failed. The mifepristone worked but not the misoprostol.

If you truly believe you are absolutely right and the other side is absolutely wrong, you will never find an acceptable compromise.\\n\\nI\\'m on the pro-choice side, and one of my core beliefs is that \"an early fetus is not developed enough to count as a person\". The pro-life side places value on the fetus being a human organism and having the potential to one day grow into a human being, often starting at the moment of conception. I place the value on the mind/consciousness of the human, features which can not exist at time of conception or for weeks afterward.\\n\\nAs such, on a personal level, I completely disagree with the points you listed on the pro-life side. Point 1 could be said to be generally true in most cases, but point 2 I would flat out call \"false\", and the conclusion of point 3 would make no sense, being based off a false assumption. That said, I still agree with the 3 points that make up the core of the pro-choice argument. So to me, we can debate the merits of third trimester abortion all day, but any attempt to regulate first trimester abortion at all is violating point 1 of the pro-choice argument for not reason whatsoever. It\\'s not a case of doing a bad thing to prevent a different bad thing (which you could make an argument for in the third trimester), but instead a case of simply doing a bad thing for no reason. By that reasoning, I will never accept *any* restriction on first trimester abortion whatsoever.\\n\\nAt the same time, someone on the pro-life side could make an argument that having sex is consent to pregnancy, and therefore provides an example where point 1 on the pro-choice argument doesn\\'t apply, invalidating both the second point and the conclusion. In doing so, that person could feel that their opinion is the correct one, just as I feel my exact-opposite viewpoint is the correct one.

While they once were a person by my definition, they have lost that capacity (and are likely only being kept alive by hospital machines anyway). This one is contentious too- some would still disagree with removing those in this state from life support, after all.\\n\\nFinally, if C is true but B is not, you have the case of a fetus. Given the time and resources it needs to grow, it will one day develop those important traits. But it hasn\\'t yet, and that\\'s important. While I\\'d personally prefer to let one in this state continue developing, I wouldn\\'t call it a person either, which makes the answer to the bodily autonomy argument clear to me- a person\\'s bodily autonomy is being violated, and the only way to solve that is to likely kill the \"may eventually one day be a person too\".

For example I’m having a vbac (regular birth after a c section) and had to sign a consent form stating I understand the risks that come from my decision to proceed which can result in death or complications. With any surgery the same happens. You sign a form consenting you understand the risks that can happen in result of the surgery. Of course no one wants the risks to happen but we have to acknowledge that they can happen with the act we are consenting to. But I’m pro choice so I don’t believe that results in consenting giving your options away on how to handle the risks involved. Same with surgeries. It’s up to you to still consent if you want life saving procedures such as a blood transfusion or not or life support.

But I think the one that it\\'s more insidious and scary is the \"There is no right and wrong\" or \"Humans don\\'t have inherent value\".

Consenting to one is accepting the known risk of the other.  \\n\\nI think it's a pretty universal opinion that consenting to an action when you are unwilling to accept the risk of a known possible outcome is irresponsible. \\n\\nNow how irresponsible it is depends on several factors, most importantly it depends on whether you believe a fetus is a life or not. \\n\\nIf you believe it is, which I'm assuming you do not, knowingly performing an action when you are so unwilling to accept the known possible risk that you are willing to kill your own innocent child to reverse that outcome is deplorable and extremely selfish.   Obviously if you don't believe it to be a life or your own innocent child at that point, you wont feel this way, but you should be able to understand why others would.  Did that make sense?\\n\\nThe most important factor in the abortion argument is the value put on a fetus. Is it a life or is it not?
