An individual that exhibits such behavior is described as a denialist or true believer.

Sometimes, doctors may cut the perineum on purpose. And epidurals increase the chance of tearing.  It is VERY painful. And they hurt for awhile. This can cause long term issues, like painful sex even after healing, increased depression and anxiety, and seeing the placenta can mentally scar women. And, the mental damage from being forced to carry a pregnancy to term, especially for someone with tokophobia, can range from small to catastrophic. Women that are forced to be or remain pregnant are likely to have more serious ill mental affects. \\n\\nAdoption isn’t a solution. 80% of children in foster care develop serious mental illnesses. \\n\\nForcing women into birth causes resentment, which causes abuse. Every year more than 3.6 million referrals are made to child protection agencies involving more than 6.6 million children.\\nThe United States has one of the worst records among industrialized nations – losing on average between four and seven children every day to child abuse and neglect. A report of child abuse is made every ten seconds. Yearly, referrals to state child protective services involve 6.6 million children, and around 3.2 million of those children are subject to an investigated report. In 2014, state agencies found an estimated 702,000 victims of child maltreatment, but that only tells part of the story.\\n\\nHealth Impacts of Child Abuse:\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention links adverse childhood experiences (which include other household dysfunctions along with abuse and neglect) with a range of long-term health impacts. \\nIndividuals who reported six or more adverse childhood experiences had an average life expectancy two decades shorter than those who reported none. \\n\\nIschemic heart disease (IHD), Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), liver disease and other health-related quality of life issues are tied to child abuse.\\n\\nMental Health Disorders, Addictions, & Related Issues, \\nRisk for intimate partner violence, \\nAlcoholism and alcohol abuse, \\nIllicit drug abuse, \\nSmoking & drinking at an early age, \\nDepression, \\nSuicide attempts, \\nSexual & Reproductive Health Issues and Risk Factors, \\nSexually transmitted diseases, \\nUnintended pregnancies, \\nEarly initiation of sexual activity, \\nAdolescent pregnancy and Fetal death\\n\\nIn one study, 80% of 21-year-olds who reported childhood abuse met the criteria for at least one psychological disorder. \\n\\nA fetus cannot feel pain until 20 weeks. Assuming that is an acceptable cutoff, banning abortion means we value a non-sentient, unconscious being incapable of pain, emotion, or having a will over a woman. It means we value dead bodies, as we cannot give organs of dead people away for donation even if it would save lives, over a woman. Abortion bans turn women into incubators. Forced birth prevents women from living their lives, reaching their goals, and just basically having independence. \\n\\n95% of women with abortions do not regret them. \\n\\n89% of women in the US that have abortions do so before the first trimester, and 2/3 do so before eight weeks. 66% of abortions in the U.K. in 2017 were medical abortions, which do NOT rip a fetus apart. They induce cramps which loosen the uterine lining, and then dilate the cervix like a very heavy, crampy period. 80% under 10 weeks there are medical abortions.\\n\\nAlso, sex is no longer considered to just be for procreation. Sex is an experience for connection, love, intimacy, and relationships. It’s very important to our culture and to ourselves and it is incredibly unrealistic to think people would be abstinent when they don’t want children when we can’t even get teens to do so. Birth control exists because we want and desire sex, we crave the pleasure and connection of another person we can feel in no other way. \\n\\nSex also has major benefits. \\nIt can boost the immune system, improve bladder control for women, lower blood pressure, it works as exercise, it lowers heart attack risks, lessens pain, reduces prostate cancer risk, improves sleep, makes you happy, relieves stress, improves cardiovascular health, strengthens your well-being, improves intimacy and relationships, makes you live longer, boosts brainpower, boosts self esteem, reduces depression, regulates periods for women, decreases risk for heart disease, and more. \\n\\nThe Oxford Dictionary definition of a person is “a human being regarded as an individual.”\\nThis brings about a question, “What is an individual?” Well, Oxford Dictionary reads, \\n“Single; separate.” \\nAmusing 20 weeks as the cutoff purely for the sake of this argument as well as recognizing when most abortions occur, it should be recognized that a fetus CANNOT be separate from the woman st this point. It is attached to her, and to separate them would inevitably cause the fetus to cease living. It is not separate and cannot be completely separate, and so it is not an individual. Ergo, a fetus is not a person. An argument could be made that this would mean conjoined twins are not individuals, but that can be easily explained by the fact that medical and mental conditions/ailments often break the rules of what we believe to be true. For example; humans are social beings, and yet we can have autism and social anxiety, which can severely impair our ability to socialize. Dementia has been considered to be the failure of the brain, causing symptoms we would before have never thought possible to occur. We need water to survive, and yet not only is it possible but there currently is at least one person in the world who is allergic to water. \\n\\nIn case you don’t want to use what the Oxford Dictionary reads...\\nWikipedia defines a person as “a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness.” \\nA fetus is capable of none of those, let alone even feeling pain before twenty weeks. The argument of before with medical and mental conditions/ailments applies here as well. The difference between people who cannot do these things because of medical/mental ailments/conditions and a fetus is that no fetus at that stage is capable of them, and it cannot be blamed on any medical or mental issue.',\n",

Evidence shows that abortion rates are higher in countries where there is limited access to contraception. Abortion rates are lower where people, including adolescents have information about and can access modern contraceptive methods and where comprehensive sexuality education is available and there is access to safe and legal abortion on broad grounds.\\n\\nWho cares if less beings without emotion, sentience, consciousness, a will, nor the capacity to feel pain die when more women are suffering, dying, and being turned into reproductive slaves, and more children are being neglected, abused, left in dumpsters, and forced to mentally rot in foster care and orphanages. I’m not trying to say that you’re an idiot or that a fetus is a ‘thing,’ it’s just not a person and not as valuable as a person. It feels less than the cows we eat. \\n\\nIn 1966, the leader of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, outlawed access to abortion and contraception in a bid to boost the country’s population. In the short term, it worked, and the year after it was enacted the average number of children born to Romanian women jumped from 1.9 to 3.7. But** birthrates quickly fell again** as women found ways around the ban. Wealthy, urban women were sometimes able to bribe doctors to perform abortions, or they had contraceptive IUDs smuggled in from Germany. Yet Romania’s prohibition of the procedure was disproportionately felt by low-income women and disadvantaged groups, which abortion-rights advocates in the United States fear would happen if the Alabama law came into force. As a last resort, many Romanian women turned to home and back-alley abortions, and by 1989, an estimated **10,000 women had died as a result of unsafe procedures.The real number of deaths might have been much higher,** as women who sought abortions and those who helped them faced years of imprisonment if caught. Maternal mortality skyrocketed, doubling between 1965 and 1989. “Sometimes a woman couldn’t even tell her husband or best friend that she wanted to have an abortion as it would put them at risk as well,” said Irina Ilisei, an academic researcher and co-founder of the Front Association, a Romanian feminist group, and the Feminist Romania website. “For many women, **sexuality represented a fear** and not a part of life that can be enjoyed,” Ilisei said. Another consequence of Romania’s abortion ban was that hundreds of thousands of children were turned over to state orphanages. When communism collapsed in Romania in 1989, an estimated **170,000 children were found warehoused in filthy orphanages. Having previously been hidden from the world, images emerged of stick-thin children, many of whom had been beaten and abused. Some were left shackled to metal bed frames.** Nor did the Romanian law do much to achieve Ceausescu’s goal of dramatically increasing the population. “Making abortion illegal will not lead to women having more babies. So if the goal is to bring about more lives and to protect more lives, this is not the instrument to use,” said Maria Bucur, a professor of history and gender studies at Indiana University. \\nUnsafe abortions are defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as “a procedure for terminating an unintended pregnancy carried out either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not confirm to minimal medical standards, or both.”\\nThey estimate that **22 million unsafe abortions** take place each year, the vast majority of which occur in developing countries. In contrast to a legal abortion that is carried out by a trained medical provider, **unsafe abortions can have fatal consequences. So much so that unsafe abortions are the third leading cause of maternal deaths worldwide and lead to an additional five million largely preventable disabilities,** according to the WHO. Deaths and injuries from unsafe abortions are preventable. Yet **such deaths are common in countries where access to safe abortion is limited or prohibited entirely, as the majority of women and girls who need an abortion because of an unwanted pregnancy are not able to legally access one.** Those who are already marginalised are disproportionately affected by such laws as they have no means to seek safe and legal services in another country or access private care. They include women and girls on low income, refugees and migrants, adolescents, lesbian, bisexual cisgender women and girls, transgender or gender non-conforming individuals, minority or Indigenous women. \\n\\nRemember, only 9 states even ask the patient to report a reason, and who knows how reliable that information reported can be. Rape victims have been psychologically injured in addition to physical injury, which is what leads to these massive levels of assaults not reported.\\n\\nStudies have shown that teaching abstinence doesn’t work, and eleven married women can get abortions. Also, sex is no longer considered to just be for procreation. Sex is an experience for connection, love, intimacy, and relationships. It’s very important to our culture and to ourselves and it is incredibly unrealistic to think people would be abstinent when they don’t want children when we can’t even get teens to do so. Birth control exists because we want and desire sex, we crave the pleasure and connection of another person we can feel in no other way. \\n\\nSex also has major benefits. \\nIt can boost the immune system, improve bladder control for women, lower blood pressure, it works as exercise, it lowers heart attack risks, lessens pain, reduces prostate cancer risk, improves sleep, makes you happy, relieves stress, improves cardiovascular health, strengthens your well-being, improves intimacy and relationships, makes you live longer, boosts brainpower, boosts self esteem, reduces depression, regulates periods for women, decreases risk for heart disease, and more.  \\n\\nPregnancy and birth actually have permanent effects on the body. (Many of these are NOT rare) This can include but is not limited to: a collapsed pelvic floor, urinary incontinence, depression, increased stress, stretch marks, hair growth and loss, skin changes, diabetes, vaginal and uterine changes, trauma, and abdominal separation. And pregnancy itself comes with an array of UNFAIR terrors for an unwilling woman: hyperemesis gravidarum, smell sensitivity, urinary incontinence, vivid and disturbing dreams, painful swelling, vocal changes, headaches and migraines, gestational diabetes, depression, constipation and indigestion, hair growth, exhaustion, dizziness, bleeding gums, sciatic nerve pain, heartburn, loneliness, and more.

Lower back contractions are notorious for making mother suffer, and can even make it feel like the pain is all over the body. Oh, and tearing! Between 79% to 90% of women experience vaginal tearing. 26% of women have perineal tearing so bad that they require stitches, and 2% have tearing that stretches all the way to the anus. Sometimes, doctors may cut the perineum on purpose. And epidurals increase the chance of tearing.  It is VERY painful. And they hurt for awhile. This can cause long term issues, like painful sex even after healing, increased depression and anxiety, and seeing the placenta can mentally scar women. And, the mental damage from being forced to carry a pregnancy to term, especially for someone with tokophobia, can range from small to catastrophic. Women that are forced to be or remain pregnant are likely to have more serious ill mental affects.',\n",

We agree, there should be a limit for elective abortion at the point of gestational age, at which a fetus can survive independently of the womb, because at that point it\\'s a premature infant.  We do however support procedures for medical reasons, all the way up to birth (that never happens).\\n\\nPregnancy is dangerous, and life threatening complications, happen even in \"normal\" pregnancies. Abortion is 14 times safer than child birth. It\\'s safer to remove still births with a d&c, than a C-section/induction. Doctors will be afraid of taking action, during life threatening complications, due to fear of being prosecuted. It\\'s happened already.\\n\\nLook at our past. Look at Ireland. Look at China. Women will be afraid to come forward with even wanted pregnancies. If they miscarry, and it turns septic, that\\'s a death sentence for the embryo/fetus, and woman. If the woman dies, the embryo/fetus dies. You can have your personal views, and effectively prevent abortion. Because banning it won\\'t work.

(Many of these are NOT rare) This can include but is not limited to: a collapsed pelvic floor, urinary incontinence, depression, increased stress, stretch marks, hair growth and loss, skin changes, diabetes, vaginal and uterine changes, trauma, and abdominal separation. And pregnancy itself comes with an array of UNFAIR terrors for an unwilling woman: hyperemesis gravidarum, smell sensitivity, urinary incontinence, vivid and disturbing dreams, painful swelling, vocal changes, headaches and migraines, gestational diabetes, depression, constipation and indigestion, hair growth, exhaustion, dizziness, bleeding gums, sciatic nerve pain, heartburn, loneliness, and more. And birth itself? Birth can take 72 hours, with heavy, painful contractions every two minutes. For those unwilling to do math, that would be 2,160 contractions. Some women don’t have time for an epidural, and some that do find themselves unable to control their bladder, move their legs, and anything, and are unable to tell how much strength is needed to push. And sometimes epidurals are needed to be administered repeatedly, causing problems LONG after giving birth. Lower back contractions are notorious for making mother suffer, and can even make it feel like the pain is all over the body. Oh, and tearing!

Sometimes, doctors may cut the perineum on purpose. And epidurals increase the chance of tearing.  It is VERY painful. And they hurt for awhile. This can cause long term issues, like painful sex even after healing, increased depression and anxiety, and seeing the placenta can mentally scar women. And, the mental damage from being forced to carry a pregnancy to term, especially for someone with tokophobia, can range from small to catastrophic. Women that are forced to be or remain pregnant are likely to have more serious ill mental affects. \\n\\nAdoption isn’t a solution. 80% of children in foster care develop serious mental illnesses. \\n\\nForcing women into birth causes resentment, which causes abuse. Every year more than 3.6 million referrals are made to child protection agencies involving more than 6.6 million children.\\nThe United States has one of the worst records among industrialized nations – losing on average between four and seven children every day to child abuse and neglect. A report of child abuse is made every ten seconds. Yearly, referrals to state child protective services involve 6.6 million children, and around 3.2 million of those children are subject to an investigated report. In 2014, state agencies found an estimated 702,000 victims of child maltreatment, but that only tells part of the story.\\n\\nHealth Impacts of Child Abuse:\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention links adverse childhood experiences (which include other household dysfunctions along with abuse and neglect) with a range of long-term health impacts. \\nIndividuals who reported six or more adverse childhood experiences had an average life expectancy two decades shorter than those who reported none. \\n\\nIschemic heart disease (IHD), Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), liver disease and other health-related quality of life issues are tied to child abuse.\\n\\nMental Health Disorders, Addictions, & Related Issues, \\nRisk for intimate partner violence, \\nAlcoholism and alcohol abuse, \\nIllicit drug abuse, \\nSmoking & drinking at an early age, \\nDepression, \\nSuicide attempts, \\nSexual & Reproductive Health Issues and Risk Factors, \\nSexually transmitted diseases, \\nUnintended pregnancies, \\nEarly initiation of sexual activity, \\nAdolescent pregnancy and Fetal death\\n\\nIn one study, 80% of 21-year-olds who reported childhood abuse met the criteria for at least one psychological disorder. \\n\\nA fetus cannot feel pain until 20 weeks. Assuming that is an acceptable cutoff, banning abortion means we value a non-sentient, unconscious being incapable of pain, emotion, or having a will over a woman. It means we value dead bodies, as we cannot give organs of dead people away for donation even if it would save lives, over a woman. Abortion bans turn women into incubators. Forced birth prevents women from living their lives, reaching their goals, and just basically having independence. \\n\\n95% of women with abortions do not regret them. \\n\\n89% of women in the US that have abortions do so before the first trimester, and 2/3 do so before eight weeks. 66% of abortions in the U.K. in 2017 were medical abortions, which do NOT rip a fetus apart. They induce cramps which loosen the uterine lining, and then dilate the cervix like a very heavy, crampy period. 80% under 10 weeks there are medical abortions.\\n\\nAlso, sex is no longer considered to just be for procreation. Sex is an experience for connection, love, intimacy, and relationships. It’s very important to our culture and to ourselves and it is incredibly unrealistic to think people would be abstinent when they don’t want children when we can’t even get teens to do so. Birth control exists because we want and desire sex, we crave the pleasure and connection of another person we can feel in no other way. \\n\\nSex also has major benefits. \\nIt can boost the immune system, improve bladder control for women, lower blood pressure, it works as exercise, it lowers heart attack risks, lessens pain, reduces prostate cancer risk, improves sleep, makes you happy, relieves stress, improves cardiovascular health, strengthens your well-being, improves intimacy and relationships, makes you live longer, boosts brainpower, boosts self esteem, reduces depression, regulates periods for women, decreases risk for heart disease, and more. \\n\\nThe Oxford Dictionary definition of a person is “a human being regarded as an individual.”\\nThis brings about a question, “What is an individual?” Well, Oxford Dictionary reads, \\n“Single; separate.” \\nAmusing 20 weeks as the cutoff purely for the sake of this argument as well as recognizing when most abortions occur, it should be recognized that a fetus CANNOT be separate from the woman st this point. It is attached to her, and to separate them would inevitably cause the fetus to cease living. It is not separate and cannot be completely separate, and so it is not an individual. Ergo, a fetus is not a person. An argument could be made that this would mean conjoined twins are not individuals, but that can be easily explained by the fact that medical and mental conditions/ailments often break the rules of what we believe to be true. For example; humans are social beings, and yet we can have autism and social anxiety, which can severely impair our ability to socialize. Dementia has been considered to be the failure of the brain, causing symptoms we would before have never thought possible to occur. We need water to survive, and yet not only is it possible but there currently is at least one person in the world who is allergic to water. \\n\\nIn case you don’t want to use what the Oxford Dictionary reads...\\nWikipedia defines a person as “a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness.” \\nA fetus is capable of none of those, let alone even feeling pain before twenty weeks. The argument of before with medical and mental conditions/ailments applies here as well. The difference between people who cannot do these things because of medical/mental ailments/conditions and a fetus is that no fetus at that stage is capable of them, and it cannot be blamed on any medical or mental issue.',\n",

Evidence shows that abortion rates are higher in countries where there is limited access to contraception. Abortion rates are lower where people, including adolescents have information about and can access modern contraceptive methods and where comprehensive sexuality education is available and there is access to safe and legal abortion on broad grounds.\\n\\nWho cares if less beings without emotion, sentience, consciousness, a will, nor the capacity to feel pain die when more women are suffering, dying, and being turned into reproductive slaves, and more children are being neglected, abused, left in dumpsters, and forced to mentally rot in foster care and orphanages. I’m not trying to say that you’re an idiot or that a fetus is a ‘thing,’ it’s just not a person and not as valuable as a person. It feels less than the cows we eat. \\n\\nIn 1966, the leader of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu, outlawed access to abortion and contraception in a bid to boost the country’s population. In the short term, it worked, and the year after it was enacted the average number of children born to Romanian women jumped from 1.9 to 3.7. But** birthrates quickly fell again** as women found ways around the ban. Wealthy, urban women were sometimes able to bribe doctors to perform abortions, or they had contraceptive IUDs smuggled in from Germany. Yet Romania’s prohibition of the procedure was disproportionately felt by low-income women and disadvantaged groups, which abortion-rights advocates in the United States fear would happen if the Alabama law came into force. As a last resort, many Romanian women turned to home and back-alley abortions, and by 1989, an estimated **10,000 women had died as a result of unsafe procedures.The real number of deaths might have been much higher,** as women who sought abortions and those who helped them faced years of imprisonment if caught. Maternal mortality skyrocketed, doubling between 1965 and 1989. “Sometimes a woman couldn’t even tell her husband or best friend that she wanted to have an abortion as it would put them at risk as well,” said Irina Ilisei, an academic researcher and co-founder of the Front Association, a Romanian feminist group, and the Feminist Romania website. “For many women, **sexuality represented a fear** and not a part of life that can be enjoyed,” Ilisei said. Another consequence of Romania’s abortion ban was that hundreds of thousands of children were turned over to state orphanages. When communism collapsed in Romania in 1989, an estimated **170,000 children were found warehoused in filthy orphanages. Having previously been hidden from the world, images emerged of stick-thin children, many of whom had been beaten and abused. Some were left shackled to metal bed frames.** Nor did the Romanian law do much to achieve Ceausescu’s goal of dramatically increasing the population. “Making abortion illegal will not lead to women having more babies. So if the goal is to bring about more lives and to protect more lives, this is not the instrument to use,” said Maria Bucur, a professor of history and gender studies at Indiana University. \\nUnsafe abortions are defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as “a procedure for terminating an unintended pregnancy carried out either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not confirm to minimal medical standards, or both.”\\nThey estimate that **22 million unsafe abortions** take place each year, the vast majority of which occur in developing countries. In contrast to a legal abortion that is carried out by a trained medical provider, **unsafe abortions can have fatal consequences. So much so that unsafe abortions are the third leading cause of maternal deaths worldwide and lead to an additional five million largely preventable disabilities,** according to the WHO. Deaths and injuries from unsafe abortions are preventable. Yet **such deaths are common in countries where access to safe abortion is limited or prohibited entirely, as the majority of women and girls who need an abortion because of an unwanted pregnancy are not able to legally access one.** Those who are already marginalised are disproportionately affected by such laws as they have no means to seek safe and legal services in another country or access private care. They include women and girls on low income, refugees and migrants, adolescents, lesbian, bisexual cisgender women and girls, transgender or gender non-conforming individuals, minority or Indigenous women. \\n\\nRemember, only 9 states even ask the patient to report a reason, and who knows how reliable that information reported can be. Rape victims have been psychologically injured in addition to physical injury, which is what leads to these massive levels of assaults not reported.\\n\\nStudies have shown that teaching abstinence doesn’t work, and eleven married women can get abortions. Also, sex is no longer considered to just be for procreation. Sex is an experience for connection, love, intimacy, and relationships. It’s very important to our culture and to ourselves and it is incredibly unrealistic to think people would be abstinent when they don’t want children when we can’t even get teens to do so. Birth control exists because we want and desire sex, we crave the pleasure and connection of another person we can feel in no other way. \\n\\nSex also has major benefits. \\nIt can boost the immune system, improve bladder control for women, lower blood pressure, it works as exercise, it lowers heart attack risks, lessens pain, reduces prostate cancer risk, improves sleep, makes you happy, relieves stress, improves cardiovascular health, strengthens your well-being, improves intimacy and relationships, makes you live longer, boosts brainpower, boosts self esteem, reduces depression, regulates periods for women, decreases risk for heart disease, and more.  \\n\\nPregnancy and birth actually have permanent effects on the body. (Many of these are NOT rare) This can include but is not limited to: a collapsed pelvic floor, urinary incontinence, depression, increased stress, stretch marks, hair growth and loss, skin changes, diabetes, vaginal and uterine changes, trauma, and abdominal separation. And pregnancy itself comes with an array of UNFAIR terrors for an unwilling woman: hyperemesis gravidarum, smell sensitivity, urinary incontinence, vivid and disturbing dreams, painful swelling, vocal changes, headaches and migraines, gestational diabetes, depression, constipation and indigestion, hair growth, exhaustion, dizziness, bleeding gums, sciatic nerve pain, heartburn, loneliness, and more. And birth itself? Birth can take 72 hours, with heavy, painful contractions every two minutes. For those unwilling to do math, that would be 2,160 contractions. Some women don’t have time for an epidural, and some that do find themselves unable to control their bladder, move their legs, and anything, and are unable to tell how much strength is needed to push. And sometimes epidurals are needed to be administered repeatedly, causing problems LONG after giving birth. Lower back contractions are notorious for making mother suffer, and can even make it feel like the pain is all over the body. Oh, and tearing! Between 79% to 90% of women experience vaginal tearing. 26% of women have perineal tearing so bad that they require stitches, and 2% have tearing that stretches all the way to the anus. Sometimes, doctors may cut the perineum on purpose. And epidurals increase the chance of tearing.  It is VERY painful. And they hurt for awhile. This can cause long term issues, like painful sex even after healing, increased depression and anxiety, and seeing the placenta can mentally scar women. And, the mental damage from being forced to carry a pregnancy to term, especially for someone with tokophobia, can range from small to catastrophic. Women that are forced to be or remain pregnant are likely to have more serious ill mental affects.',\n",

If she wanted to keep the child, she would be doing it out of her own free will, and thus would not be reduced to that of an inanimate object. If she doesn’t want a child but is forced to carry it due to oppressive laws and a lack of medical options, she is deprived of her right to her autonomy and is reduced to the status of an object because others are dictating what she can and cannot do with her own body.
